# 🧠 Hierarchical ML for Market Regime Detection and Trading Strategy Performance Prediction

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains the implementation developed as part of my Bachelor Thesis, *“Hierarchical Machine Learning for Market Regime Detection and Trading Strategy Performance Prediction.”*

The project explores the performance of classical trading strategies such as SMA crossovers, RSI, and Bollinger Bands, combined with **market regime fine-tuning**.  
A model that performs well under one regime can fail catastrophically in another if it assumes the underlying structure is stable.  
To address this, the framework integrates **unsupervised regime detection** with **neural network models** that forecast the profitability of trading signals while being *regime-aware*.

> Rather than predicting raw price movements, this framework forecasts when specific trading strategies are likely to succeed or fail, providing a more interpretable, practical, and robust approach to market prediction.

## 🧩 Methodology Overview

The architecture follows a hierarchical, two-stage design:

1. **Market Regime Detection**
   - **Stage 1:** A UMAP + GMM clustering model detects broad market regimes (e.g., Bull, Bear, Neutral, U.S. Bull Only).
   - **Stage 2:** Within Bull regime, a UMAP + Spectral Clustering model separates *Aggressive Bull* and *Defensive Bull* subregimes.

2. **Strategy Profitability Prediction**
   - For each day and strategy signal, Long/Short, (e.g., SMA crossover or RSI trigger), features are computed from OHLCV data, technical indicators, and categorical context such as trading asset, and regime-derived variables.
   - A **global neural network** learns general profitability patterns across assets.
   - **Fine-tuned regime-specific networks** adapt the model to each detected regime.

The framework forecasts whether a given trading signal is likely to be profitable over a 10-day horizon.

## 📊 Results Summary

The models were trained using Alpaca API data spanning **2016-01-16 to 2025-07-20**, evaluated on assets such as **SPY, QQQ, EFA,** and **USO**.

### Performance Across Regimes

| Metric | Random Baseline | Global Model | Fine-Tuned Models |
|:-------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
| Mean PR-AUC (All Regimes) | 0.444 | 0.488 | **0.505** |

Fine-tuned models outperform both the random baseline and the global model in all regimes except the Neutral one.

### Return Optimization

When annualized ROI is plotted against the decision threshold:
- The **Global Model** achieves -0.7% ROI at a 0.5 threshold.
- **Fine-Tuned Models** peak at **+7.9% ROI** with a 0.56 threshold.

## 🚀 Usage

The main execution script allows you to generate profitability predictions for trading strategy signals within a chosen date range.

```bash
python main.py --start YYYY-MM-DD --end YYYY-MM-DD
```

**Example:**

```bash
python main.py --start 2025-10-15 --end 2025-10-17
```

### 🧾 Example Output

After running, a `.txt` file like the following is generated in your working directory:

```
Total number of predicted profitable trading strategy signals: 2

timestamp   symbol   strategy                             signal          pred_prob
2025-10-15   USO     SMA Crossover - 10/20d windows        Long Position   0.594590
2025-10-17   SPY     RSI - 14d period                      Short Position  0.583820
